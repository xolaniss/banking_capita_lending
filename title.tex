\begin{abstract}
This study estimates the impact of the Basel III capital requirement on bank lending in South Africa. Following the ideas of Fang et al. (2020), we estimate a series of panel regressions using monthly balance sheet data from the biggest four banks. These banks represent 80\% of banking assets. We find a smaller impact compared to other studies of between 0.8 and 2.4 percentage points. However, we surmise this is mainly due to these banks being well-capitalised, given the consistent capital buffers by the banks.
